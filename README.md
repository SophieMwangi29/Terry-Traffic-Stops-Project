# Terry-Traffic-Stops-Project
## Overview
This project is aimed at finding out if unreasonable search and seizure of an individual by a police officer is justified. This will be done by finding out if each Terry Traffic Stop (the unreasonable search or seizure) recorded in Seattle led to an arrest. This will be done by looking at the individual's features provided in the data and how they contribute to their arrest.

## Business and Data Understanding
Stakeholder Requirement and Problem
Our stakeholder is the Supreme Court of Ohio. This is to help them understand if the Terry V. Ohio case was ruled accordingly and to ensure that such cases presented to them do not violed the Fourth Amendment that states;

The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

The inspiration to conduct this project was stemed from the event that caused Terry and his three friends to face 3 years imprisonment due to unreasonable searches and seizures and above all the need to protect the officer's safety incident to the investigation by the state.
