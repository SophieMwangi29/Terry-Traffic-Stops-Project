# Terry-Traffic-Stops-Project
This project is aimed at finding out if unreasonable search and seizure of an individual by a police officer is justified. This will be done by finding out if each Terry Traffic Stop (the unreasonable search or seizure) recorded in Seattle led to an arrest. This will be done by looking at the individual's features provided in the data and how they contribute to their arrest.
